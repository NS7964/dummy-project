		<h1>Why are angery man with work pressure?</h1>
		<p>
			At more speeches to women than I can count, the question I pose is: “How many of you see yourself as CEO of your company?” Maybe one or two women raise their hands. Usually it takes going down the hierarchy to department or division level before a critical mass of women will indicate they could see themselves as running that place in the organization.
